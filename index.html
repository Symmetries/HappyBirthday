            Happy birthday to our resident grandma (despite your non-grandma-like sleep schedule this semester)! Have a great day, and I'm looking forward to travelling Europe together - bring me to a cool rock concert!

            Happy Birthday!!! Until now, more than half the time we've known each other has been online-only, and yet it's been a blast all the same. I'm really looking forward to being in-person friends again!

            Happy Birthday StatsGirl (I'm kidding haha, we all know Shereen is the real StatsGirl shhh)!! It's been great knowing you, even though Covid robbed us of almost a year of hanging out. Have a great day, and hope we'll be able to celebrate soon in person, as you deserve!

            Happy birthday Gabriela! You are the best lecturer I have this semester I swear. It is sad that when we get closer, COVID hit so we cant hang out in person but we should definitely go to  Keste place immediately once this over! Have an amazing day, I wish to be there with you to celebrate your birthday. Also all the best with grad school application and your internship with Google! You will rock it! :heart:  :heart: :heart:
